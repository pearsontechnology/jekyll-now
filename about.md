The Pearson Cloud Platforms team has been operating for three years. We are a global team based in US, UK, India and Sri Lanka. Together we are responsible for delivering and operating the future digital education platform at Pearson. We are championing the use of open source and cloud native technology to support Pearson's digital transformation.

You can go to our [Github](https://github.com/pearsontechnology) to see the projects that we have authorised for public release and we will update on this blog as others are made available, typically we release code under Apache 2.0 or MIT licenses.

As part of our community strategy, we release our learnings both in the form of code and also blog and documentation as we find solutions to issues running container orchestration and microservice architecture at scale in production.

### Conferences & Case Studies

We can often be found attending meetups and conferences all over the world. If you are interested in having us attend or speak at one of your events, please [email us](mailto:chris.jackson@pearson.com). We do not provide endorsements for commercial software and services but we are happy to show support for communities we work with. Please refer to our examples for [Stackstorm](https://stackstorm.com/case-study-pearson/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/case-studies/pearson/) to get a feel for how we like to work with community partners.
